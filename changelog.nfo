- fixed claw_ravager and aven_bolter's build picture
- fixed sphere_adv_vehicle_factory's wreckage

gui_xta_defenserange.lua
gui_hlight_unit.lua
unit_stockpile.lua
unit_z_selector.lua
gui_greensquares_v3.lua
camera_smooth_move.lua



------------------ NOTES v0.2 ----------------------


--- unit changes
- miscellaneous tweaks to several units
- units that explode violently on death are now cheaper overall (for example SPHERE's level1 small fusion reactor)
- replaced ARM "Raven" with "Bolter" : level 2 Heavy Rocket Kbot
- added ARM "Stasis" : level 3 EMP Cannon
- added SPHERE "Stout" : level 2 Armored Gun Turret
- added SPHERE "Rain Maker" : level 2 Shielded All-terrain Radar Jammer/Missile Kbot
- added SPHERE "Tick" : level 2 All-terrain Assault Kbot


--- widgets / GUI
- added simple and advanced player list widgets
- updated commanders name tags widget (names were missing)
- added commander selection widget (ctrl+c wasn't working)






------------------ NOTES v0.1 ----------------------

- it has most land, air and some sea units for CLAW and SPHERE

- each commander has 3 distinct upgrade paths, depending on whether you want to improve mobility, durability or range (does not improve resource generation or build power).

- has new units for arm and core as well, some of the existing units were reworked, some (maverick, annihilator, doomsday, etc.) were given new 3do models

- metal makers have been disabled, but all commanders give +4 M/s

- economy scales smoothly, moho mines provide about 3 times as much metal as mexes, for 60 E/s

- commanders can be respawned in commander respawners (which can be built by any constructor). Respawning costs 1000M and 10000E and takes about 30s (can't be assisted). Experience is saved, but not upgrades (need another 30s and +1500M, 10000E to upgrade)

- for now, it has no mine-layers, no nukes, and no vulcans (does have berthas though)

- all ground units have 600 LOS and aircraft have 720 LOS (there is no distinct radar and sonar LOS) (has LOS widget)

- not compatible with any AI, for now

- it has a special tooltip widget that shows the armor type and hitpower types of the unit's weapons

- has team color widget that makes the player blue, allies teal, enemies red

--- ARMOR vs HITPOWER
- Light (L)       (takes full dmg from all sources)
- Medium (M)    (takes half dmg from light hitpower weapons)
- Heavy (H)    (takes half dmg from medium hitpower weapons and quarter dmg from light hitpower weapons)

(throwing a mass of flashes or scout ships against medium and heavy armored units should fail miserably)

- SPHERE's unit shields protect only the owner, take 2x dmg from paralyzer weapons, and regenerate 2%hp/s at the cost of 4%hp E/s
(they take dmg according to the unit's armor type, for now)
